# OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS
The purpose of this analysis  was to conduct a database analysis using SQl for Pewlett Hackard to  determine the number of retiring employees per title for all departments, and identify current employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program with employees that will be retiring. 

# RESULTS
An ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was used to visualize the relationship between the data sources and the structure of the company's employee plan to facilitate the analysis. Primary keys in each dataset were used to link datasets in order to extract the information needed for the analysis.
