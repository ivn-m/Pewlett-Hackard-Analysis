- An estimated 1549 employees are eligibile for the mentorship program
- If all of the Engineers on this list were promoted to Senior Engineers, it would not be sufficient to meet the demand for Senior Engineers after the Silver Tsunami.

# SUMMARY
There are a total of 72,458 employees at Pewlett Hackard getting ready for retirement. There are  or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives, which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come.
