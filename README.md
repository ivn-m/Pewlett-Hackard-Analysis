# OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS
The purpose of this analysis  was to conduct a database analysis using SQl for Pewlett Hackard to  determine the number of retiring employees per title for all departments, and identify current employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program with employees that will be retiring. 

# RESULTS
An ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was used to visualize the relationship between the data sources and the structure to facilitate the analysis. Primary keys in each dataset were used to link datasets in order to extract the information needed for the analysis.

- An estimated 1549 employees are eligibile for the mentorship program
- If all of the Engineers on this list were promoted to Senior Engineers, it would not be sufficient to meet the demand for Senior Engineers after the Silver Tsunami.

# SUMMARY
There are a total of 72,458 employees at Pewlett Hackard getting ready for retirement. There are 1549 employees eligine for mentorship initiatives. Considering te overwhelming amount of employees retiring from Pewlett Hackard, the company will likely need to engage in a massive hiring campaign to replace the employees that are leaving. Since a significant portion (70%) of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a buffer for the talent and expertise that will be lost due to the Silver Tsunami.
